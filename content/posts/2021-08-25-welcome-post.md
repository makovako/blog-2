# Hello world

Oh sorry, this is not a programming language. But it printed hello world anyway ðŸ™‚.

Hi, I am makovako, I do and try variety of things and activities. Some of them deserve to be written down. I have a diary, for my private stuff, but some things, opinions or experiences are better, when are shared. Someone might even read it and learn something new.

I am not sure, what else should be in my first post. Maybe some more information about me might be nice, but I am more of a privacy focused guy, so I will be shy to share much information, especially from my life. But from time to time there is a topic I would like to save on the internet and share with the world, not just let it slowly be forgotten in my offline memories.

I might update this post in the future to better introduce myself. For now, this will be enough.
